<center>Install necessary gems:</center>

`gem install ecdsa securerandom digest rubygems rqrcode`

<center>Run the Script</center>

`ruby wif_ecsda.rb`

<center>Files Description</center>

```
- wif_ecsda.rb : It generates a new Key-pair everytime it executes. Supports WIF and compression bit. Doesn't support BIP32 seed generation. It also shows a QR-Code of the address that can be scanned by any wallet application. It also opens blockchain.info to explore the corresponding address in Google Chrome _(Chrome has to be installed for this to work.)_   

- base58.sh : It passes the checksum-appended-key to btemp.sh

- btemp.sh : Generates a valid base58 encoding. 

- Wallet-qrcode.png : QR-Code of the address.	

```
<center>Tests</center>

```
- Able to successfully import the generated private key in Electrum Wallet. 
- Mobile application wallets are able to successfully scan the QR code. 
- Block Explorer validates the generated block address.
```
<center><h1>CAUTION!</h1></center>

<p>

This script generates addresses for the mainnet. Do not use it unless you know how to import a wallet from a private key. This is only for educational purpose and is not the most secure way to handle wallets. Please look into BIP32 implementation https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/interim-2017-cfrg-01/materials/slides-interim-2017-cfrg-01-sessa-bip32-ed25519-01.pdf of wallets which are much more secure.
P.S Do not share the private key with anyone.
